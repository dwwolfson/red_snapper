Workflow for Hanks approach:

1. Fit a quasi-continuous path model to telemetry xyt data. The ctmcmove package facilitates this through the "mcmc.fmove" function.

2. Create or import raster layers (from package "raster") for each covariate.

3. Impute a quasi-continuous path (done jointly with model fitting in the "mcmc.fmove" function.

4. Turn the quasi-continuous path into a CTMC discrete-space path using the "path2ctmc" command.

5. Turn discrete-space path into Poisson GLM format using the "ctmc2glm" command.

6. Repeat #3 - #5 multiple times (M times). Stack together the response "z", model matrix "X", and offset "tau" elements from each imputed path.

7. Fit a Poisson GLM model to the stacked data with response "z", model matrix "X", offset "log(tau)", and weights for each row equal to "1/M".

7 (alternate). Alternately, multiple imputation could be used, as described in Hanks et al., (2015).
