# ctmc characteristics

- large positive coefficients suggest quick transitions
- crw is a directional covariate (that measures degree of directional persistence)



# Model complexity

- can consider models where transition rates depend on time of day
- can consider directional persistence
- random effects or two-step approaches
- direction to nearest "reef"
- 0 step lenghts and measurement error?
- instantaneous and quick transitions (tau < 10^-5?)
- difference in categories (move to better habitat)


# Comparisons

- simulate movements from both models and see which seems to better match real movements (how easy is it for non-specialists to identify the real movement path from a set of simulated paths)?
