red snapper mvmt analysis collab

To Do (4/10/2021):
SSFs
i) filter to include only 3 individuals that Juliana choose
ii) set a subsampling rate (every 5 min, 10 min, ...., 1 hour...)
iii) generate random steps/turns
iV) fit our 3 SSF models
V) calculate mean speed, mean turning angle

ctmc
i) filter to include only 3 individuals that Juliana choose
ii) select a grid cell size (1 m^2, 5m^2, 10m^2, ...)
iii) data development
iV) fit ctmc models

Then, compare SSF and cmtc across different cell sizes:
i) mean speed in each habitat vs. ? mean transition probability out of a cell in habitat type 1-4
ii) mean turn angle vs. the crw parameter

and eventually

iii) simulated movements, real movements

Maybe going forward we can try opening new issues for tasks to complete and self-assign?
